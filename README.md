# Messenger notificaition on website change
Here is a sample code.

This is not the original source code (with contains credentials and private website url).
But it is a standalone working Python script.

Running on Linux with this crontab: * * * * * cd /home/messenger/live/; ./main.py website.com/subfolder/file.php
